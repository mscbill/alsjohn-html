                    Humanity was willed in being by a divine being, or created by a unconscious evolutionary process, so

                    of life’s
                    meanings, life’s purposes, is to emulate our creation by being creative.

                    My interest in photography goes back to early childhood when I used my father’s camera to take
                    pictures of war game play at school in the second grade. Since then it has been off and on, more off
                    than
                    on. I’ve shot film, developed my own black & white film, learned monochrome printing, and eventually
                    through the Smithsonian Resident Associates studio arts class, learned to print color.

                    After a hiatus of a few years I switched to exclusively digital photography in 2012. Film
                    photography could be fun but it was a laborious process compared to digital photography, not to
                    mention being more
                    expensive.

                    With retirement photography will serve as a challenge, a discipline, and a spiritual practice to
                    celebrate life. In 2021 I took a class called “A Year of Creative Photography” which has pushed me
                    along
                    the path I am seeking.
